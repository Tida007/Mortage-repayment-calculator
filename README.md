## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this project challenge.

**To Build this project, basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is required.**

## The challenge

challenge is to build out the mortgage repayment calculator and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

Task is to build out project to the design inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design

Also included is a variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information needed, such as color palette and fonts.

**Cheers!** ðŸš€
